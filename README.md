## Project Description

Practice integrating SQL Server + CRUD Operations with ASP.NET environment to create a database of violin students for a theoretical violin studio. I applied CRUD to demonstrate basic operations in a student sign in portal (add, delete, edit), which is applicable to many real-life situations.
